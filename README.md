## Gambit: Certora's Mutation Generator for Solidity

This is a mutation generator for Solidity.
Mutation Testing is a technique for
  evaluating and improving test suites or specifications used
  for testing or verifiying Solidity smart contracts.

Gambit traverses the Solidity AST generated by the Solidity compiler
  to detect valid "mutation points"
  and uses the `src` field in the AST to directly mutate the source.

Gambit is implemented in Rust which
you can download from [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

### Users
You can learn how to use Gambit by running
`cargo gambit-help`.
It will show you all the command line arguments that Gambit accepts.

As you can see, Gambit accepts a configuration file as input where you can
  specify which files you want to mutate and using which mutations.
You can control which functions and contracts you want to mutate.
Examples of some configuration files can be found under `benchmarks/config-jsons`.

#### Examples of how to run Gambit:
- `cargo gambit-cfg benchmarks/config-jsons/test1.json`
- `cargo gambit benchmarks/RequireMutation/RequireExample.sol`
- For projects that have complex dependencies and imports, you will likely need to
  pass the `--base-path` argument for `solc` like so:
`cargo gambit path/to/file.sol --solc-basepath base/path/dir/.`.
If you are using a config file, you can also pass this argument there as a field, e.g.,
```
{
  "filename": "path/to/file.sol",
  "solc-basepath": "base/path/dir/."
}
```
For using the other command line arguments, run `cargo gambit-help`.

### Developers
We are happy to accept contributions to Gambit! A few tips:
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a good IDE for Rust development.
- Run `make` before you push --- it will build Gambit and run all the tests.
